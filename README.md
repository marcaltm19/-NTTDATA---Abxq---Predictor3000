***Inspiration*** <br></br>
Our inspiration came from the collective realization that as first-year computer science "rockies," we were essentially navigating through uncharted territory. We figured, if our predecessors survived, surely we could too, armed with nothing but determination and a few questionable coding memes for moral support.

<br></br>
***What it does*** <br></br>
Despite our initial lack of knowledge, our project, affectionately named "Abxq" (because why not throw some random letters together?), surprisingly manages to not crash and burn. It's a testament to our ability to wrangle code into submission and make it do something vaguely resembling what we intended.

<br></br>
***How we built it***<br></br>
Armed with Google, a mountain of energy drinks, and a healthy dose of imposter syndrome, we tackled the project head-on. Our development process involved fervent Google searches, trial-and-error coding, and the occasional sacrifice of a keyboard to the coding gods. Pair programming quickly turned into a chaotic group debugging session, with more laughs than lines of code.

<br></br>
***Challenges we ran into*** <br></br>
Oh boy, where do we begin? From syntax errors that seemed to multiply like rabbits to the infamous "semicolon hunt," our journey was riddled with challenges. We quickly discovered that the real magic in coding lies in the ability to decipher error messages that seem to be written in a language only known to the computer itself.

<br></br>
***Accomplishments that we're proud of*** <br></br>
Against all odds, we managed to produce a functioning project. It might not be the most elegant piece of code, but it's ours, and we wear its quirks and idiosyncrasies with pride. We conquered the treacherous terrain of programming as a group of first-year "rockies," and for that, we deserve a round of applause (or maybe just a collective sigh of relief).

<br></br>
***What we learned*** <br></br>
Aside from the obvious lesson that coding is both an art and a science, we learned the value of collaboration, resilience, and the importance of taking breaks when the infamous "code blindness" sets in. We discovered that the computer science community is more forgiving than we thought, as long as you're willing to laugh at your mistakes and learn from them.

<br></br>
***What's next for Abxq*** <br></br>
The sky's the limit for Abxq! Well, maybe not the sky, but at least the next computer science assignment. Equipped with newfound knowledge and battle scars from our coding adventure, we're ready to take on whatever challenges come our way. Next stop: conquering more complex projects and, of course, mastering the art of writing code that doesn't require a detective to debug.
